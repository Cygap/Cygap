### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am full-stack developer with a strong focus on JavaScript and TypeScript. I have experience in developing web applications using React, Redux, NestJS, and GraphQL on the frontend, and NodeJS, ExpressJS, and Knex on the backend. I happen to be well-versed in project management and have a track record of managing successful IT projects, including the implementation of corporate-wide ERP and new workflows on K2 for MS SharePoint. Writing technical documentation, setting-up CI/CD, using Agile methodologies are also a part of my undertakings. 

You can always contact me via [cygapb@gmail.com](mailto:cygapb@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub] profile)
