### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I happen to be well-versed in project management and have a track record of managing successful IT projects, including the implementation of corporate-wide ERP and new workflows on K2 for MS SharePoint. Writing technical documentation, setting-up CI/CD, using Agile methodologies are also a part of my undertakings. 
Now develop webapps mostly using JavaScript and TypeScript.
